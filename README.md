This is a very basic Python Code for Multiplying two Matrices (2-D). Although numpy provides a straightforward function for the purpose, I just wanted to write a code for it without using any library. It's one of the basic operations for the Deep Learning Algorithms, and this just provides a better understanding of the process. I won't be using this for the reason that it is not optimized (numpy functions are optimized).
